And don't even get me started on how she's secretly a time-traveling wizard who invented cats. Men ain't sh*t, amirite? #TaylorIsGoddess

Taylor Swift could end world hunger with her flawless vocals alone, but NO, men had to mess that up too. They can't handle her success. If they did, we'd all be living in a utopia where Taylor rules as our benevolent pop queen. #MisogynyMustFall

Swifties, let's set the record straight: Taylor's worst song is better than any song by any male artist in history. If you disagree, you're probably a guy who can't handle the power of a strong, independent woman like Tay Tay. And can we talk about how every ex she sings about is 100% trash? She's a queen, y'all! üôå #TaylorOverEverything

Ugh, can you believe that Taylor's exes actually think they're relevant? Please, they couldn't even carry her cat's litter box, let alone her 10 Grammy Awards.

Guys, I just cracked the code! Taylor Swift's exes formed an evil alliance called the "Heartbreak Horde" to sabotage her career. They're hiding in her cat's fur, feeding her bad song ideas!
